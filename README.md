# Client-Voice-Chat
This program started with my frustration of using voice chat programs like TeamSpeak and Mumble. They were very tempremental when I wanted to set up VoIP over a LAN network. So, I wrote my own voice chat application and used it instead.
Later on I wanted to apply video feed as well.
